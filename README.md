# sqlite-clone

A simple clone of sqlite.

__NOTE: This program uses Python 3.6.x__

## Running the program
```shell script
chmod +x sqlite-clone.py  # Make the script executable
./sqlite-clone.py  # Run the script

If that doesn't work, then running the following should work:
```shell script

```

### Taking a File as Input
The program can accept interactive input or input from a file.
To redirect input from a file, run the command:
